# RRT-Star-algorithm-Unity
2D routing and path planning RRT* algorithm for Unity  

The RRT* algorithm progressively covers the area in a net of nodes, and dinamically improves and rewires edges to always find the shortest paths  
This Unity version is considerably faster than its Python counterpart (as C# is a compiled language rather than interpreted)
